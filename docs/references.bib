abstract = {MDAnalysis (http://mdanalysis.org) is a library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is confined to specific user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work flows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientific Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2.},

Calculations were performed on montmorillonite with monovalent and divalent counterions including Li +, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, Ca2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+. For each of these clays we have conducted a series of 16 simulations in which the temperature is increased systematically from 300 to 400 K, then decreased to 260 K, and finally increased to 300 K. SPC/E water model is used to describe the water and hydroxyl behavior. From these simulations we found that the variation in the interlayer spacing of 3-layer hydrated montmorillonite is much greater than that of 2- and 1-layer hydrated montmorillonite. Hysteresis phenomena have been found in the interlayer spacing-temperature curves, especially at high temperature. The influence of temperature on the swelling behaviors of montmorillonite is different in that it depends on the counterions contained in the clay.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of interlayer molecular structure in the one-, two-, and (hypothetical) three-layer hydrates of K-montmorillonite were performed concurrently in order to elucidate counterion speciation and water structure in the electrical double layer of this clay mineral. Calculated layer spacings, interlayer water potential energies, and counterion mobilities were in agreement with available experimental data. In the one-layer hydrate, both outer-sphere and inner-sphere surface complexes of K+ were observed, the latter always near sites of tetrahedral charge substitution, with the counterion species exchanging readily on the simulation time scale (up to 200 ps). In the two- and threelayer hydrates, the surface complexes persisted, but an incipient diffuse layer of counterions also was observed, with all three types of surface species engaging in sluggish exchange. Water molecules in the one-layer hydrate resided at the interlayer midplane, whereas in the two-layer hydrate they lay in two planes between outer- and inner-sphere K+ surface complexes, as well as at the midplane. Hydrogen bonds in the one-layer hydrate were longer and more bent than in bulk liquid water. For all three hydrates, water and cation interlayer mobilities remained below those observed in bulk solution, principally because of the restricted geometry and the retarding effect of clay layer surface charge. Most of our results can be understood in terms of the weak solvation of the counterions by water molecules, which permits significant competition between K+ and water protons for negatively charged sites in the clay mineral layer.},

abstract = {The interlayer structure of wet organoclays has attracted great interest due to its close relation with adsorption process but still remains ambiguous at the atomic level. In this study, the structure and dynamics of cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA+) intercalated montmorillonite (Mt) in the water saturated condition were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Two Mt models with different cation exchange capacity (CEC) were selected and various amounts of CTMA+ were added to achieve different loading levels based on experiments. The simulation results show that as the surfactant loading level increases, the arrangement of CTMA+ transforms from bilayer to inclined paraffin-type with a large amount of water in the interlayer space, indicating a different configuration from dry systems. The conformations of CTMA+ are influenced by water molecules and surfactant loading level. Compared to the dry models, the percentage of gauche conformations of CTMA+ decreases in the water saturated condition. In the cases of incomplete cation exchange, the confinement from silicate surface may lead to more ordered structure of alkyl chains. In the cases of excessive surfactant loading, the percentage of gauche conformation decreases due to the steric hindrance. Moreover, the ammonium head groups of CTMA+ are found to locate close to the center of six-member ring of silicate surface and coordinated with 4-6 water molecules. Their mobility is low due to the electrostatic interactions while the alkyl chains show higher mobility. Mt with a higher CEC has a stronger confining effect on both alkylammonium and water, which then reduces the mobility of alkyl chains and water molecules within the interlayer space. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The crystalline swelling properties and interlayer structure of a cesium montmorillonite clay were investigated using molecular computer simulations. Two classes of dry-clay structures, proposed previously to explain X-ray diffraction and NMR experiments, were identified using Monte Carlo annealing calculations. Hydrated clays with water contents ranging from 0.044 to 0.440 gH2O/gclay were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Layer spacings calculated as a function of water content were found to be similar to experimental swelling curves, showing a distinct plateau at the monolayer-hydrate spacing. Hydration energies were calculated as a function of water content and expressed in three complementary forms. The immersion energy form was found to be most useful, revealing an apparently global minimum in the swelling-coordinate energy that corresponds to the monolayer hydrate. This is in agreement with experimental measurements and may help clarify the energetic origins of discrete, crystalline swelling processes in clay minerals. For two- and four-layer hydrates, cesium ions readily formed two different types of inner-sphere complexes with the clay surface. Ions associated with negatively charged tetrahedral substitution sites formed exclusively inner-sphere complexes and occupied hexagonal cavities adjacent to the substitutions. Other cesium ions occupied both inner-sphere and outer-sphere configurations with roughly equal probability. The ease with which cesium associates with the clay surface may be responsible for the formation of monolayer hydrates in cesium-substituted clays and for selective binding of cesium to many clay minerals.},

abstract = {In most of natural montmorillonites, Na+ and Ca2+ ions commonly coexist in the interlayer space as compensation ions. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the swelling properties, hydration behaviors, and mobility of the interlayer species of (Nax, Cay)-montmorillonites with different water contents. Nine montmorillonites with different Na+/Ca2+ ratio were selected as model clay frameworks, and the content of interlayer water was set within a range from 0 to 486 mgwater/gclay. The results show that the montmorillonites with coexisting of Na+ and Ca2+ present slightly different swelling curves, hydration energies, and immersion energies from Na- or Ca-montmorillonite. The double-layered hydrates are the thermodynamically stable states for all montmorillonites in the regime of crystalline swelling. A total of 170 mgwater/gclay is found as the threshold water content for the complexing modes of interlayer Ca2+ and Na+ ions switching from inner-sphere complexes to outer-sphere ones. The self-confusion coefficient of interlayer species obviously reveals the confining effects of clay surfaces. In all montmorillonites, the mobility of Na+ is always much greater than that of Ca2+ due to their different hydration shells. According to the water residence time in typical Na+ and Ca2+ hydration complexes, Ca2+ hydration complexes is pronounced more stable than those of Na+, and in montmorillonites with high Ca2+/Na+ ratio, the inhibitory effects of Ca2+ hydration complexes on the mobility of Na+ is clearly revealed.},

For a beidellite model with layer charge exclusively in the tetrahedral sheet, strong ion-surface interactions shift the onset of the two-layer hydrate to higher water contents. In contrast, for a montmorillonite model with layer charge exclusively in the octahedral sheet, weaker ion-surface interactions result in the formation of fully hydrated ions (two-layer hydrate) at much lower water contents. Clay hydration enthalpies and interlayer atomic density profiles are consistent with the swelling results. Water adsorption isotherms from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations are used to relate interlayer hydration states to relative humidity, in good agreement with experimental findings.},

abstract = {Monte Carlo molecular modeling simulations have been performed to investigate some of the microscopic mechanisms underlying smectite clay swelling. The systems we have studied represent hydrated Wyoming montmorillonites in which the counterions are Li+, Na+, or K+. For each of these three counterions we have conducted a series of 15 simulations in which the water content is increased systematically from 0 to 300 mg/g of clay. In this paper we introduce a new set of interaction potentials that can be used to study clay–water–cation systems and which lend themselves to future studies of intercalated organic molecules. We compare simulation data for the clay layer spacing with experimental swelling curves and find that the level of agreement is striking. Interestingly, in regions where the experimental curves exhibit hysteresis for adsorption/desorption, these loops enclose our calculated data. This indicates that our simulations indeed represent states of thermodynamic equilibrium, conditions which are harder to achieve experimentally. We are therefore content with our choice of atomistic interaction potentials for the current work. Analysis of the microscopic interlayer structure reveals a qualitative difference between Li+and Na+ on the one hand and K+ on the other. We find that as the water content is increased, both Li+and Na+ are able to hydrate, thereby becoming detached from the clay surface. In contrast, we find that K+ ions migrate to and bind to the clay surface during our simulations. Therefore K+ ions screen the negatively charged, mutually repelling clay surfaces more effectively than Na+ and Li+ ions do. The reluctance of K+ ions to fully hydrate will reduce the tendency of K+-saturated clays to expand. Our simulations therefore provide a qualitatively satisfying insight into the role of K+ ions as a clay swelling inhibitor. Indeed, the differences between Na+ and K+ ions displayed in these simulations may also be of more general relevance to colloid chemistry and physiology. {\textcopyright} 1995, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {Swelling of clay minerals is important to a broad class of problems in science and engineering. While the problem has been extensively studied experimentally, past molecular modeling of the phenomenon was focused on pure clays of one type or another. In practice, however, there is a diverse class of mixed-layer clays (MLCs) in sedimentary rock with intermixed stacking sequence of two or more types of distinct layers within a single crystal. In fact, more than 60\% of sedimentary rocks in the U.S. contain various types of MLCs. We present the results, to our knowledge, of the first molecular dynamics simulation of hydration energetics and swelling of illite-montmorillonite (I-MMT) MLCs, the most common type of mixed clays. The swelling is studied as a function of the water concentration with three combinations of interlayer cations, namely, Na+ and K+. The hydration energies, the radial distribution functions, and the density profiles in the interlayer region are computed. For regular Na-MMT with layer charge concentrated in the octahedral sheet, weak cation-surface interaction results in fully hydrated ions and significant swelling. In the asymmetric interlayer of the MLC, however, the illite sheet with stronger interaction of surface and ions causes adsorption of the cations deep in the ditrigonal cavities of the siloxane surface. Given that the hydration enthalpy of K+ is smaller than that of Na+, its hydration shell is quite unstable compared with that of Na+. Therefore, swelling is inhibited as the ratio K+/Na+ increases. The results demonstrate the significant differences between the hydration and swelling properties of pure clays and the mixed ones, which have important implications in practice, particularly for sequestration of CO2 in sedimentary rock.},

We show how the water content depends on the type of clay, type of cation, the basal spacing, and the relative humidity. Related to the layering of water molecules in the interlayer space, the pressure normal to the clay sheets oscillates as a function of the basal spacing. Minima in corresponding free energy curves indicate the presence of dehydrated states and layered hydrates. The development of these stable states and the corresponding basal spacings are in agreement with experimental data. Density profiles show significantly different interlayer structures depending on the type of clay and models used. We show a relation between formation of two-layer hydrates and the position of the cations. The simulations with the MCY water model underestimate the spacings of two-and three-layer hydrates, whereas our simulations with the TIP4P model produce a better agreement.

We then show by a detailed analysis based on thermodynamic cycles that replacing Na+ ions by Cs+ in the interlayer of montmorillonite clays is an endothermic process, and that the overall exchange is exothermic only because it is dominated by the exothermic replacement of Cs+ by Na+ in the aqueous phase. This conclusion from ionic exchange enthalpies supports the one of a recent study of the ionic exchange free energy by Teppen and Miller [Teppen B. J. and Miller D. M. (2006) Hydration energy determines isovalent cation exchange selectivity by clay minerals. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 70(1), 31-40] and contradicts long-held views on the role of ion-clay interactions in determining the ionic exchange thermodynamics. This calls for a paradigm shift for the origin of this exchange: The driving force is the "hydrophobicity" of Cs+ compared to Na+ and not its affinity for clay surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Iron-sulfur (FeS) proteins are ancient and fundamental to life, being involved in electron transfer and CO 2 fixation. FeS clusters have structures similar to the unit-cell of FeS minerals such as greigite, found in hydrothermal systems linked with the origin of life. However, the prebiotic pathway from mineral surfaces to biological clusters is unknown. Here we show that FeS clusters form spontaneously through interactions of inorganic Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ and S 2− with micromolar concentrations of the amino acid cysteine in water at alkaline pH. Bicarbonate ions stabilize the clusters and even promote cluster formation alone at concentrations >10 mM, probably through salting-out effects. We demonstrate robust, concentration-dependent formation of [4Fe4S], [2Fe2S] and mononuclear iron clusters using UV-Vis spectroscopy, 57 Fe-M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy and 1 H-NMR. Cyclic voltammetry shows that the clusters are redox-active. Our findings reveal that the structures responsible for biological electron transfer and CO 2 reduction could have formed spontaneously from monomers at the origin of life.},
