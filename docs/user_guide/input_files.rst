Input Files
============

There are two types of input files required to run :code:`ClayCode.builder`. A mandatory :ref:`.yaml file <input_files_yaml>` and an optional :ref:`.csv file <input_files_csv>`. It should be noted that if a .csv file is omitted, these parameters should be in the .yaml file. See the :ref:`Pyrophyllite tutorial <pyro_tutorial>` for an example.
