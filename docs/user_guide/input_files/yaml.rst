.. _input_files_yaml:YAML file==========For the .yaml file to be read by :code:`ClayCode.builder`, the relative path must be specified when calling the function.Multiple YAML files are supplied with :code:`ClayCode` within the :code:`Tutorial` directory. The files are named by their corresponding clay system (e.g. :code:`NAu1.yaml`), and can be used as examples.Required Parameters--------------------The required input parameters are general directives for model construction.:code:`OUTPUT` : /path/to/directory [ str ]    Path to directory in which the output folder is created:code:`CLAY_COMP` : /path/to/file.csv [ str ]    Path to input .csv file:code:`SYSNAME` : clay_name [ str ]    Name of the clay system. It must match a column header in the :ref:`CSV <input_files_csv>` file. The created output folder will also have this name.:code:`CLAY_TYPE` : unit_cell [ str ]    | Clay unit cell type. Must match a directory in :code:`data/UCS/` (see :ref:`data files <data_files>`). For example, a Dioctahedral 2:1 unitcell is :code:`D21`.    | *Note:* Only D11, D21 and T21 are supplied with the current release.Optional Parameters---------------------There are a number of optional parameters. If no directives are given by the user, :code:`ClayCode.builder` will use the default values.Clay Sheet Size~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:code:`X_CELLS`: x_unit_cells [ int ] (Default = 5)    Number of unit cells in the x-direction:code:`Y_CELLS`: y_unit_cells [ int ] (Default = 5)    Number of unit cells in the y-direction:code:`N_SHEETS`: sheet_number [ int ] (Default = 5)    Number of sheets of 1 unit cell thickness to be stacked in the z directionClay Composition~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:code:`ClayCode.builder` uses the supplied .csv file to calculate the number and type of unit cells necessary to match the desired composition. These can also be supplied manually using the following parameters. See the :ref:`Pyrophyllite tutorial <pyro_tutorial>` for an example.:code:`UC_INDEX_LIST`: unit_cells [ list ]    List of unit cells to be used for building the model. These must have corresponding :code:`.gro` and :code:`.itp` files in the :code:`data/UCS/CLAY_TYPE` directory.:code:`UC_RATIOS_LIST`: cell_probabilities [ list ]    List of probabilities for the above unit cells. The total probability must equal 1.Interlayer Solvent and Ions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:code:`IL_SOLV`: solvent_presence [ bool ] (Default = True)    If true
