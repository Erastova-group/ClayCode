Kaolinite 


**NOTE** treatment of the Ti in the structure and what is the origin of the Ti, why to ignore


Kaolin KGa-1(KGa-1b), (low-defect)

ORIGIN: Tuscaloosa formation? (Cretaceous?) (stratigraphy uncertain)
County of Washington, State of Georgia, USA
LOCATION: 32°58′ N-82°53′ W approximately, topographic map Tabernacle, Georgia N 3252.5-W 8252.5/7.5, Collected from face of Coss-Hodges pit, October 3,1972.
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION (%): SiO2: 44.2, Al2O3: 39.7, TiO2: 1.39, Fe2O3: 0.13,FeO: 0.08, MnO: 0.002, MgO: 0.03, CaO: n.d., Na2O: 0.013, K2O: 0.05, F:0.013,P2O5: 0.034, Loss on heating: -550°C: 12.6; 550-1000°C: 1.18.
CATION EXCHANGE CAPACITY (CEC): 2.0 meq/100g
SURFACE AREA: N2 area: 10.05 +/- 0.02 m2 /g
THERMAL ANALYSIS: DTA: endotherm at 630oC, exotherm at 1015oC, TG: dehydroxylationweight loss 13.11% (theory 14%) indicating less than 7% impurities.
INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY: Typical spectrum for well crystallized kaolinite,however not as well crystallized as a typical China clay from Cornwall,as judged from the intensity of the 3669 cm-1 band. Splitting of the 1100cm- 1 band is due to the presence of coarse crystals.
STRUCTURE:(Mg.02 Ca.01 Na.01 K.01)[Al3.86 Fe(III).02 Mntr Ti.11][Si3.83Al.17]O10(OH)8, Octahedral charge:.11, Tetrahedral charge:-.17,Interlayer charge:-.06, Unbalanced charge:0.00
