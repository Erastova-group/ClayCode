a bit confusing with this statement:

Composition of matching unit cell group:

	Group 0:
	          	UC occupancies
	UC index  	00
	atom type 
	'T' - 'st'	  8
	'O' - 'feo'	  4


Group 0 is Nontr state as 'base group UC composition'? 


---

do not delete the .csv 

---

minimisation: 
save run output into a foolder

if not converged tell user to check the files, mb provide some info (like the last output from te run)

---

repeat solvation & try to minimise OR print out current state & quit



---
Accept unit cell group? [y]es/[e]xit (Default y)

if no - offer the other?


--
Accept matched clay composition? [y]es/[e]xit (Default y)

if no suggest new values

---

many yes or exit (may be only for verbose/interactive mode?)


---

exp_csv to have ions as per clays org. ATN it is ration summed to 1
